# Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- `documentation/html`: Contains HTML documentation.
- `executables`: Contains executables for both Mac users and Windows users.
- `src`: Source code files for the project.
- `test`: Contains test framework.

# Installation and Tests
## Install
Compile the main user interface.
```
cd src
g++ -std=c++17 -o project Filter.cpp Slice.cpp Projection.cpp Volume.cpp Image.cpp main.cpp
```

Run the project
```
./project
```
## Run the existed executables
For Mac users:
```
cd executables
./MacOS_project
```
Please do not run by click it directly!
## Test
Important: 
1. All the functionalities are implement in three classes: Filer, Projection, and Slice. As a result, only functions in these classes are tested. Other Class(Volume and Image) is designed as the interface for the main.cpp applying Facade design pattern. These interfaces are not going to be tested here.
2. Please note that the test is a MacOS exclusive feature.

Compile the test framework.
```
cd test
g++ -std=c++17 -o test ../src/Slice.cpp ../src/Projection.cpp ../src/Filter.cpp TestSlice.cpp TestProjection.cpp TestFilter.cpp mainTest.cpp
```

Run the test
```
./test
```
